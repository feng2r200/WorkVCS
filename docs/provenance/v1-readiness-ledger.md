# V1 Readiness Ledger

Status: current implementation-readiness ledger
Last refreshed: 2026-09-01 by ADR-0422 / Phase 4LG

This ledger tracks the current WorkVCS V1 implementation state. It is an
evidence map, not a product specification. Confirmed product, architecture,
schema, and ADR documents remain the authority for what WorkVCS means.

The ledger exists to correct implementation focus: later slices should close
V1 readiness and dogfood gaps before adding more narrow query-detail or
expectation-only work.

## Classification

- **Design confirmed:** repository product, architecture, schema, or accepted
  ADRs confirm the capability semantics.
- **Implemented:** the current local Rust core or CLI exposes the capability.
- **Smoke proven:** repository automation exercises the capability at the
  process boundary, usually through `scripts/smoke-v0.1-cli-workflow.sh`.
- **Dogfood proven:** the capability has been used in a real WorkVCS-style
  continuation or handoff loop outside a throwaway smoke Store.
- **Open / next action:** the most concrete remaining V1 gap.

`Partial` means some sub-capabilities are covered while the named V1 area is
not complete.

## Current Ledger

| V1 area | Design confirmed | Implemented | Smoke proven | Dogfood proven | Open / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical IDs, digests, and WorkState hashing | Yes | Yes | Partial | No | Keep as regression foundation; no further work unless another V1 slice exposes a concrete compatibility gap. |
| Store bootstrap, open, manifest, lineage, and doctor | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Phase 4LE creates a durable local dogfood Store for a full implementation closeout; next prove the path with a larger Store validation run. |
| Workspace, Branch, history, show-at, diff, and restore | Yes | Yes | Partial | No | Create a real dogfood walkthrough that branches and restores Work State for an implementation slice. |
| Goal, Plan, Task, ordering, dependencies, and containment | Yes | Yes | Partial | Partial | Phase 4LE uses a real WorkVCS Task through implementation closeout; still use WorkVCS itself to manage a nontrivial Goal/Plan. |
| Acceptance Criteria, Verification Requirements, Verification, and Evidence closure | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Phase 4LE dogfoods AC/VR/Verification for an implementation closeout; repeat this in recovery and handoff-consumption scenarios. |
| Verification command wrapper | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Extend beyond caller-supplied observation data only after Resource adapter/path normalization is confirmed; keep multi-target, shell execution, and LLM extraction outside V1 unless re-authorized. |
| Resource registration, observation, applicability, and drift | Yes | Partial | Yes | Partial | Resource-backed stale-cache recovery from baseline observations is implemented; Resource path/glob normalization and adapter-backed re-observation remain Open. |
| Session start/end/focus, Runnable projection, `claim next`, and `next` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Phase 4LG dogfoods a focused Handoff continuation that is initially blocked, then recovers and continues through the focused Task. |
| Claim modes and guard behavior | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Phase 4LG dogfoods the blocked Handoff takeover recovery path with guard failure, explicit stale marking, stale-gated forced takeover, and recovered guard success; Claim transfer remains smoke-proven but not yet real-project dogfooded. |
| Context resolver | Yes | Partial | Yes | Partial | Phase 4LF proves current Context is sufficient for focused Handoff continuation; complete remaining V1 categories: AC packets, Goal/Plan path packets, richer blocker context, Attempt details, path-sensitive Knowledge policy, packet persistence, and claim-next packet rendering. |
| Record, Decision, Knowledge, and `why` neighborhoods | Yes | Yes | Partial | Partial | Phase 4LF inspects `why` during Handoff continuation and finds zero relation edges for the Handoff focus link; decide that relation semantics before adding `why` output. |
| Handoff | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Phase 4LG proves focused Handoff continuation and blocked recovery through stale-gated Claim takeover; repeat on another real project before claiming broad dogfood maturity. |
| Merge lifecycle | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Dogfood divergent Work Branch resolution and document recovery behavior for moved heads or unresolved items. |
| Checkpoint and Bundle portability | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Validate a real export/import/restore path and record Bundle container/profile details still Open for V1. |
| CLI discoverability and operator use | Partial | Partial | Partial | Partial | Phase 4LF reduces Handoff focus-copy friction with `handoff consume`; continue reducing manual key-value capture only where dogfood shows repeated friction. |
| Actionable errors and recovery | Yes | Partial | Partial | No | Audit common failures and document safe next actions; add behavior only where current errors block dogfood. |
| Larger Store and performance evidence | Partial | No | No | No | Run a representative larger Store workload before adding indexes or claiming scale readiness. |

## Dogfood-Biased Next Queue

Use this queue when selecting the next local implementation slice unless a
current user request supplies a narrower priority.

1. Decide whether Handoff focus belongs in `why` as a relation, using the Phase
   4LF zero-edge evidence before changing explanation semantics.
2. Complete the remaining V1 Context Resolver categories when the verify and
   handoff surfaces can supply real packet content.
3. Reduce manual key-value capture in the operator CLI only where the dogfood
   evidence shows repeated friction.
4. Run larger Store validation before designing performance indexes.
5. Use WorkVCS on another real project before claiming broad dogfood maturity.

Narrow smoke expectation, list/detail, count, and display-only slices are still
valid when they are required for one of the gaps above. They should name the
ledger row they advance.

## V2 Exclusions

The following remain beyond V1 even if they would make dogfood easier:

- transcript parsing or automatic extraction of Findings and Decisions;
- LLM-generated semantic records without explicit Agent confirmation;
- embeddings, vector search, or semantic retrieval;
- LLM-based semantic merge or natural-language conflict detection;
- automatic knowledge distillation;
- hooks that infer and prompt for possible semantic records;
- Agent launching, scheduling, orchestration, or automatic execution;
- cloud synchronization, distributed collaboration, and live cross-Store
  federation;
- destructive compaction of core Decision, Finding, Knowledge, ChangeSet, or
  WorkStateCommit history; and
- required TUI, GUI, or human-first storage.

## Evidence Snapshot

- `workvcs --help` currently exposes the broad V0.1 command surface, including
  Store, history, Workspace, Branch, Goal, Plan, Task, AC/VR, Evidence,
  Resource, Record, Session, Claim, Context, Next, Runnable, the high-level
  `verify` wrapper, Verification, Projection, Bundle, Checkpoint, and Merge
  command families.
- `scripts/smoke-v0.1-cli-workflow.sh` is the repository process-level smoke
  entrypoint and has been extended through ADR-0414 to cover integrity,
  scheduling/claim-next, context profile/budget packets, Merge, Checkpoint,
  Bundle, divergence, and VR-backed AC closure through the `verify` wrapper.
- The core test inventory currently contains focused tests for the major
  implemented V1 areas.
- Current smoke Stores are temporary and scripted. Phase 4KX adds a local
  dogfood Store for context packet budget behavior. Phase 4KY adds a local
  dogfood Store for the single-target `verify` wrapper and records one concrete
  recovery gap: after a Task completion advances the branch head, Resource-backed
  Verification applicability is stale until the cache is refreshed for the new
  head. Phase 4KZ adds explicit `verification cache-refresh` recovery for the
  baseline-observation case and replaces the manual `cache-record` recovery step
  in repository smoke. Phase 4LA adds focused `handoff create/show` commands
  over existing SessionDiff and `Record(kind=handoff)` semantics, and smoke now
  proves an end-session, handoff-author, handoff-consume loop. Phase 4LB adds
  explicit Claim transfer and forced takeover replacement operations over
  existing Claim occurrence/runtime/Event tables; smoke now proves a blocked
  guard, transfer recovery, and forced takeover recovery loop. Phase 4LC adds a
  local operator quickstart and recovery guide tied to the current CLI surface.
  Phase 4LD adds explicit `session mark-stale` support and smoke-proves
  `potentially_stale` show/list behavior. Phase 4LE makes forced Claim takeover
  stale-gated, fixes the previous Session lifecycle evidence, and dogfoods a
  real implementation Task/Session/Claim/AC/VR/Verification/SessionDiff/Handoff
  closeout. Phase 4LF dogfoods a focused Handoff as the continuation entrypoint,
  adds `handoff consume`, and records that `why` still does not expose the
  Handoff focus link as a relation. Phase 4LG dogfoods a focused Handoff
  continuation blocked by another Session's active Claim, then recovers it with
  explicit stale marking and stale-gated forced takeover. WorkVCS has still not
  been used for another real project.
